# "Doom" written in `bc`

The iTerm2 terminal has long included a tool for displaying images in the console, and I was looking for a reason to use it to make an interesting project. In the end, I created a port of the game Wolf5k, originally written in JavaScript.

During the process, I had to face a lot of difficulties. The thing is, `bc` is a fairly simple language. For example, it lacks any built-in functionality for graphics output. In order to work with graphics, I had to develop my own base64 encoding function and generate images in BMP format.

I had to struggle, inventing various things that aren't available in the language. In the end, I managed to port the game in a day and spent the following day leisurely fixing bugs.

The controls in the game are managed with the `A`, `S`, `D`, `W` keys or `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, Space â€” to shoot.
